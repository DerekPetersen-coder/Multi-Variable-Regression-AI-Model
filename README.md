# Multi-Variable-Regression-AI-Model
First Multi-Variable AI Model I Made
This project is a simple multivariable linear regression model that predicts house prices based on:

- Square Footage
- Number of Bathrooms
- Number of Bedrooms

It was built in Python using:
- `pandas` for data handling
- `scikit-learn` for training the model

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `data.csv` | The training data for the model |
| `main.py` | The Python script that trains and uses the model |


-> To install required libraries,
  pip install pandas
  pip install scikit-learn

  Sample Predictions:
    Input:
      SquareFootage-4500
      Bath-4
      Bedrooms-8
    Output:
      550,000
